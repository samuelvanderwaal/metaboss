# Metaboss CLI binary installation script
# ------------------------------------
#
# Shamelessly borrowed from Sugar CLI: [https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar/blob/main/script/sugar-install.sh]
#
# The purpose of this script is to automate the download and installation
# of the Metaboss binary.
#
# The script does a (simple) platform detection, downloads the binary
# for the detected platform and copies it to a folder in the PATH variable.
# 
# Currently the supported platforms are Windows, macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS
# running variations of the sh Unix shells.
